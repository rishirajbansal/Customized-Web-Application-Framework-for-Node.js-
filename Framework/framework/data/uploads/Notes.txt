Suppose a person feels nervous in the face of a difficult situation because he thinks he is unequal to it and has no one to help him or sympathise with him. His nervousness weakens him all the more, so that even before he has attempted to solve the problem, he gives up. The way a yogi would respond is different. He would have the firm faith that God is his companion and helpmate, and since God is Almighty and invincible, he would not entertain the slightest thought of failure. Such faith works like many horsepower of energy. He applies all his strength and abilities to the problem and, often, succeeds. This does not mean there are no failures, but his faith in God gives him the inner strength to face any reverses without disappointment or despair.

Everyone wants that his partner should like, that she understand about his feelings, his pain, what he like etc. However, there are very few, who actually think opposite, i.e. whar his partner wants, understand her feelings, pain, what she like etc. Become oppostie, give happiness to your partner rather then expecting, it will really leave no room for sadness and depression.

The one who is calm and cool is the one who makes the right decisions.

Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition


Once you realize your own strengths, you are able to value yourself immensely. If you value yourself, it does not matter so much to you whether another values you or not. You need to know that you are unique and that you are worth a great deal. If the other person does not value you it is their loss; they are losing something precious.

Positive thoughts bring positive results



==========

Today I will be prepared and in control. When people do take me for a surprise, I will be alert and be ready to move ahead. I will not let any accidents happen nor will I be led away from my path. With my vision firmly on my goal, I will move ahead. 

When you have to correct someone in any situation remind yourself that words will not work but silence based on pure feelings and love will surely work. When you accept the person as he is with love you will be able to bring about a change in him. Remember that the lesser you talk the more the peace that is created. 

Unconditional love or love that only wants to give and not take or expect, strengthens and is healing, it never hurts or inflicts pain on the other. 

The one with a calm state of mind is able to think creatively and see very clearly even beyond the situation. So there is the ability to transform the seemingly negative situation into something very positive. 

When I am free from worry, I constantly remain satisfied for having seen the positive and finding the solutions immediately instead of looking at the problem and worrying over it. This internal silence gives the feeling of power, which naturally enables transformation in a second and only the goodness is absorbed.

Fatal error: Can't use method return value in write context in
Prior to PHP 5.5, empty() only supports variables; anything else will result in a parse error. In other words, the following will not work: empty(trim($name)). Instead, use trim($name) == false.
You have to set $obj->address() into its own variable, and test this variable with empty().

But if in the present, he remembered God a lot and continued to perform good actions, slowly over a period of time, God would help him and he would overcome the sorrow in his life. Also, by remembering God and performing positive actions, the influence of his past actions on his present would be reduced, so as to bring a positive change of events on his life which would make him happier. This is true for all of us.

Story
----
A critical gearbox failed and no one could fix it. So they brought in a bloke with great trouble-shooting experience. He inspected the gear drive very carefully. After looking things over, the guy reached into his bag and pulled out a small tool. He gently tapped something. Before long, the gearbox was back working! The owners got his bill for $10k. "What?!" the owners said, "You hardly did anything. Send us an itemized bill.” The reply simply said:  Tapping with a hammer. .$50  Knowing where to tap. .$9950

# Customized-Web-Application-Framework-for-Node.js 

A Node.js based web framework that can work as a base or foundation to develop multiple applications top on it. It aims to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, session management, and so on. It should be well suited for large-scale or complex enterprise level projects. A quite stable framework that can help developers create scalable web applications that are flexible in various business requirements.

This web development framework comes with an inbuilt component-based model, database abstraction layers, event-driven programming features, and modular application architecture. It supports Rapid Application Development (RAD). It allows to get web applications up and running quickly. Moreover, with this framework, it also becomes convenient to customize applications as per changing business requirements. 

Major Functional areas : 

It provides a robust set of features for web applications and delivers useful HTTP utility methods and middleware.

1.	Productivity: Productivity is a measure of how quickly one can create new features after getting familiar with the framework, and includes both the effort to write and maintain code

2.	Caching support: Support for caching. Caching is an optimization to store all or part of a web request so that it does not have to be recalculated on subsequent requests. Returning a cached request is much faster than calculating one in the first place.

3.	Scalability: This framework is capable to cope and perform under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or even increase its level of performance or efficiency when tested by larger operational demands. Scalability is the ability for the application to gracefully meet the demand of stress caused by increased usage. In short, ensuring the application doesnâ€™t slow or bust when pounded by more users than it was originally anticipated.

4.	Web security: Support for handling common web attacks. It sanitizes all user input from HTML templates so that user-entered JavaScript cannot be run. It comes with authentication and authorization, that enable the web server to identify the users of the application, and restrict access to functions based on some defined criteria. Different techniques are used to surface such security vulnerabilities at different stages of an applications lifecycle.

5.	Maintainability: Maintaining the application or enhancing the features in the application are no more complicated process in this solution. The framework is highly robust and capable to trace out the issues or problems intelligently and inform them via logs. Enterprise logging mechanism is in place which traces all the events occurring in the application in sophisticated and structured format that makes it easy to read by anyone. This solution can handle any no. of enhancements or loads introduced in the future. It more like a foundation which can use to build multiple floors one on the above.
